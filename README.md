# Weather App

Search for a city and discover the current weather and temperature in a cute way.

The purpose of this project was to get me back at personal projects, so I started at something easy first.

To run this project locally you will need an apiKey from [openWeather site](https://openweathermap.org), but don't worry, it's free.

after getting your apiKey you can clone it:

```bash
git clone 'repository url'
```

Access its folder:

```bash
cd weather-app
```

Create and .env file with the same content as the .env.example and put you apiKey there.

Install its dependencies:

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

And finally run it:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```
